<!-- Web document: ACCESSIBILITY  
by default you will not see the div blocks on the screen, that s where the presentation will have an effect !


WAI-ARIA (Web Accessibility Initiative’s Accessible Rich Internet Applications),
or just ARIA:
- a specification that declares itself “a bridging technology.”
- it fills semantic gaps with attributes until languages like HTML provide their own
equivalent semantics: you cannot describe everything with HTML5, the number of commands is not infinite.
With the role, you can specify more directly the purpose of a block.

The main "role":
- banner: a place that contains information related to the site, not information that is 
specific to the page.
- navigation: a collection of navigational elements.
- main: the main content of a document.
- complementary: a supporting section of the document, it is a complement to the main document, 
it can be used as a standalone document.
- contentinfo: a region in the document that will contain information about the parent document.
It can be include the copyright information, address of the author of the document... (footer element)
