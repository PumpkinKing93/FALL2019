<!-- With the tag style, it it possible to include information related to the presentation of the different elements 
You can think of the definition of each HTML tag as a static class where you set parameters to the properties of the tag.
By default (if you dont associate any information), it will be displayed with a black font, with a basic formating structure.
You can check what was the default presentation with the previous examples that were given.
