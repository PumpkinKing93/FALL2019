/*
 * Title: Intelligent Traffic Light System
 * Language: C++
 * Description: In this project, you are required to simulate an intelligent
 * traffic light system with multithreading. A sensor is placed at each street
 * intersection and communicates sensors in the car when close enough
 * (50-100 meters). A FIFO queue is maintained by the sensor at the
 * intersection to store RTP (Request To Pass) by cars. Cars whose request is
 * at the HOL (Head of Line) is granted permission without stopping at the
 * intersection. Your program should simulate random car arriving on the four
 * directions and keeps running without deadlock, crashing, or unexpected termination.
 *
 * Note:
 * (i)   FIFO queue can be considered a shared resources for all the cars
 * 			when they arrive and leave;
 * (ii)  you can assume each car takes 3 seconds to
 * 			drive through the intersection;
 * (iii) turns are not required for implementation.
 *
 * Bonus (15%): implement an improvement where N cars in one direction is given
 * permission before allowing cars in another direction to pass. In addition,
 * cars in opposite directions should be able to pass simultaneously without
 * waiting for each other.
 *
 * Bonus (10%): analyze the performance of your program through extensive
 * experimental data. Metrics to analyze include average time to pass the
 * intersection (waiting + time to drive through) and average waiting time.
 * You can compare it with the "stop sign rule".
 */

/*
 * Summarized:
 *  1: Multithreading
 *  2: Shared FIFO Queue
 *  3: Head of Line Automatically Goes in Base Implementation
 *  4: Random Car Arrivals
 *  5: 3 Seconds to go through Intersection
 *  6: No Turning
 *
 *  B1 : Implement Multiple Cars going at once
 *  B2 : Implement a "Stop Sign Rule" for comparison and do Data Gathering
 */

/*
 * We assume:
 * 	People follow the rules of the road.
 * 	The stop-lights themselves are run by another system that reads the state of the sensor.
